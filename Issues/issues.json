    "body": "The AOM/BTM were implemented for design space exploration, so each branch and offset entry is described as a separate memory instance. It is unknown if Quartus correctly infers that these memories are all addressed in contiguous and non-overlapping ways, and so condenses them into fewer MLABs. Especially given that many of the AOM/BTM entries are mapped along a single memory word.\r\n\r\nAlso, Quartus may be using MLABs more finely (per ALM, rather than per LAB), making space optimizations in the source moot.\r\n\r\nSolving #46 may also moot this issue, as it will remove the big muxes, and reduce all these simultaneously addressed memories into single ones addressed by the LSBs of the Address."

    "body": "Related: #56 \r\n\r\nIf we add a bit mask to the offset of the AOM, we could do DSP-like circular buffers in power-of-two sizes (and alignments? tied to pointer base address?). Cheap, but a little inflexible.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can add a counter and a second Programmed Increment (PI): after N-1 accesses with increment I, the Nth access uses another increment J, which could be negative. \r\nIf J == I, then we have arbitrary circular buffers, of size limited by the counter.\r\nIf J == I-1, then we have a sliding window (e.g. for FIR filters)\r\n\r\nMax cost: one 10/12 bit counter, and double the number of 10/12 bit PI entries.\r\nWe would have to store the extra PI as a separate memory fetched in parallel, one of which selected by a flag set by the counter before getting added to PO. Based on the improve Controller (fig 5.6, pg. 94 in thesis), a mux before the PO+PI adder, in the same pipeline stage, *might* be fast enough.\r\n\r\nNote: this __strongly__ interacts with #46, which would remove the multiplexers from the AOM design, and shorten them the one stage needed to fit them after pipeline stage 1.

Memory-map per-thread entries in a single word: 4*4  = 16 bits. Writing to word updates all 4 entries.\r\n\r\nPlace table in ALU, replacing Logic Unit:\r\nALU0: read LUT Memories\r\nALU1: register MLAB output, as always.\r\nALU2: drive 4:1 muxes, one per output bit, selected by A and B bit, maps perfectly to 6-LUT hardware (Cyclone V and Stratix IV)\r\nALU3: replace final mux with 4:1 mux: Logic, Add/Sub, MHI, MLO\r\nWill need careful experimentation to preserve Fmax, but shouldn't be hard.\r\n\r\nNote: first investigate combining Add/Sub with Logic operation, as per Warren's \"Hacker's Delight\".\r\n\r\nUse first 4 opcodes as index into 4 entries, giving programmable, universal 2-term boolean logic opcodes. Easy to default to XOR/AND/OR/NOT. By default, all zero entries encode to a result of 0, regardless of A/B inputs, preserving NOP and address 0 operation.\r\n\r\nBenefits: reduces all 2-term boolean operations to a single instruction. \r\n\r\nBest case: unoptimized logic (e.g.: ~(~A * ~B)), reduces 4 operations to 1, but that could be trivially optimized to A + B beforehand. DeMorgan's Law also guarantees that any operation with 2 negations can be converted to one with 1 negation.\r\n\r\nCommon case: operations with a single negation (e.g.: ~A * B), reduces from 2 to 1 operation. Basically all negations vanish, reducing any compound boolean sequence with N terms to the best sequential case of N-1 operations.\r\n\r\nSee: http://iie.fing.edu.uy/investigacion/grupos/microele//iberchip/pdf/75.pdf (\"Classifying n-input boolean functions\", Correia and Reis) for characterization of all 16 possible 2-term boolean functions.\r\n\r\nSee: bit-manipulation papers/thesis by Yedidya Hilewitz, Princeton PALMS group, now at Intel.\r\n\r\nWould be much more powerful with 3 terms, as in CUDA 6.0, but that would require adding a C memory to fetch alongside A/B, which is an icky architectural change.\r\n"

The D operand of branches now wraps around I memory 4 times, or put another way, ignores the two upper bits.\r\n\r\nThus, as-is, the H memory is write-only and a good place to put hardware extensions which aren't interactive.

      "description": "**Handshaking support has the highest importance, as other enhancement and future expansions depend on it.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, I/O reads and writes always complete, regardless of the readiness of the other end. Thus, any readiness check must use a busy-wait loop. We must add a simple 4-phase req/ack handshake on I/O reads and writes to effectively support many peripherals (i.e.: DRAM controllers), a larger memory hierarchy, and for overlapping communication and computation (a simple 1-stage handshaking write FIFO would allow a write to proceed and the writer to go on and compute while the reader eventually acknowledges the write.)\r\n\r\nThe tricky part comes when handling a not-ready I/O operation: \r\n* We must annul the current instruction\r\n * Almost free: use the register clear input to turn it to a NOP, see [Instruction Set Architecture](https://github.com/laforest/Octavo/wiki/Instruction-Set-Architecture)\r\n* We must prevent any other I/O handshake in the same instruction from finishing, since they have side-effects. (e.g. lost data)\r\n * A little harder: we must check all D, A, and B operands, since they could all be I/O.\r\n* We have to carry the instruction annulment decision to the Controller, so we can re-issue the *previous* PC value (likely by subtracting 1 from the current one) for that thread to re-issue the annulled instruction.\r\n* The same issues happen, but with more complication, when we include the read from Instruction Memory as potentially originating from an I/O port: if we assume some post-incrementing addressing after each read (to process instructions from an external memory), how do we make sure to not post-increment if the handshaking hardware annuls the instruction later due to a non-ready Data Memory (A and/or B) read and/or write?\r\n\r\nFinally, we must for now assume that no two threads read/write from the same I/O port, as the handshaking could cause their reads/writes to happen in the opposite order, destroying the assumption of fixed round-robin thread ordering.\r\n\r\nIf we mux the I/O port amongst the threads (see #9), then as the final write of an instruction happens several cycles down the pipeline (_in the future_) from the reads, so we have to use the readiness state of the write port as it was in the *previous* instruction in the same thread. Thus the 'ack' line needs to be properly delayed so as to coincide with the read port check in the same thread.\r\n",
