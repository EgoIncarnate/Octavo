This directory contains the Verilog-2001 source for a "raw" version of Octavo.
It is meant to be self-contained, untouched by external code generators, and
containing all the (parametrizable) parts you need to build variations of
Octavo. You should never need to touch this code short of fundamental
architecture changes. 

Accelerators are tacked on to the I/O ports, and SIMD variations just duplicate
the DataPath as required.

At a minimum, create a wrapper module that sets the parameters for the Octavo
module in Octavo.v and breaks-out all the individual I/O ports from the raw I/O
port vectors.

Code and test harnesses and test benches are defined on a per-custom-version
basis.
